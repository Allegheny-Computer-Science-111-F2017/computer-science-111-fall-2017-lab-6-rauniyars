# Reflection by Sweta Rauniyar

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. In this program,
we had to use string methods to create interdisciplinary text-based output.
While working on the program in the beginning, I was facing difficulty in
replacing the strings with their `respective complements. I was able to fix
that out after referring to the related content in the text-book.

The next step I stumbled on was in inserting a new character in the string
specifically in using the 'generator.nextInt()' but with the help of one of the
teaching assistants, I was able to figure that out. I figured out that it was
necessary for us to declare the generator in all the steps as that was required
to create the desired output. Step 5 that was related with changing a random
position in the DNA string to a randomly chosen DNA letter was quite
challenging compared to others and took a lot of time and effort in solving it.
Seeking help from theTeaching Assistant, I was able to resolve it.

This assignment was one of the difficult ones that we have done until now but I
believe that with utmost practice and dedication, I will be able to work on it
well. I am curious about how the computer choses random strings while we use
the random function and hence I look forward to learn about it in detail.
